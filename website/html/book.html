      <p>This book was an idea Andrew and I had back when we were working together at BuzzFeed
        around 2014. I had started as a data science out of my PhD in physics, and he had been
      working for years as a software developer. There was so much we had learned on the job as
      data scientists that we had never come across in the classroom. At the same time that the
      knowledge was experiential, it was also explainable. We thought it would be easy enough to
      turn into a book, and that we could save others the time it took us to gather all these
        lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book isn't finished. There's a great deal on the application of the more theoretic
        insights in the latter half of the book that we didn't have the space or time to add this
        time around. We'll look forward to revising and expanding for a second edition, where we hope
        to give a more thorough treatment of components of distributed systems, like REST APIs, queue-readers
        and schedulers, and how these can be combined as components of machine learning platforms powering
        modern data products.
      </p>
      <p>
        For its incompleteness, we hope that you'll find this is the resource that was missing early
        in your career when you're entering the workforce from your educational background, and looking
        for the missing link between academic pedagogy and practice. We hope it will help you in the transition
        from machine learning in an academic setting to machine learning in production.
