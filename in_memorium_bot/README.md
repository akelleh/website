# InMemoriumBot

The imgur community memorializes individuals by posting about their life and deeds periodically. Some users don't like this practice, because it earns "points" for the poster in bad taste. It's customary to downvote one of the poster's other posts while upvoting the memorial post, so OP is point-neutral overall, and the memorium continues.

On one thread, @theseanannigan had a better idea. What if someone created a bot to periodically post memorium posts. We wouldn't have to think about the points at all, and we'd also be sure to never forget.

This is that bot. I've created a post for community feedback here: https://imgur.com/gallery/1IBEOse

I'd love feedback on how the bot could improve, other memorial posts to add, and any other feedback you can come up with. Just add them to the comment section! While you're there, be sure to up/down vote the other comments, so I can get an idea of what people want to see!
